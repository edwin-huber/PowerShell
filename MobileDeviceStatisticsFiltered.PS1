# This script retrieves a number of mobile devices specified by the user and returns the statistics
# In this case, we are just filtering on when the device partnership was created, and when it was
# most likely re-provisioned (Policy reapplied)
# We limit the number of devices, in order to avoid potential throttling, and to allow validation 
# of theories against smaller data sets. (easier to analyse and evaluate)
# This is currently only a very basic implementation for proof of concept
# Use at your own risk.
